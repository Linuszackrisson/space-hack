# space-hack# Project Overview

As part of the Space-hack team, I took on the challenge of a Figma project aimed at creating a pixel-perfect clone. My task demanded meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that every element closely mirrored the original design. After dedicated efforts, I'm thrilled to present the achieved result, striving for a seamless replication of the initial design in every pixel.
